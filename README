1.GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git*. Download and install Git with synaptic    package manager.
                 System ---> Administration  --> Synaptic Package Manager

  Create account on www.github.com
2.Create the ssh key pairs if you dont have already
   If you have then take their backup and remove them.
    $ls
    $ mkdir keybackup
    $ cp id_rsa* keybackup
    $ rm id_rsa*
  Now create new keys as below.
    $ ssh -keygen -t rsa -c 'your emailid'
  Now give the file name to store keys.
    /home/causecode-1/.ssh/id_rsa
  now enter passphrase
  again enter passphrase
  Keys are automatically generated and stored in given file.
3.Link These keys to your account.
  Open given file.
  Copy Key as it is.
  Open a/c on github.com
  Go to Account settings  ---> SSh keys  ---> add ssh key ---> apply
4.Check connection using 
  $ ssh -t git@github.com
5.Now add your name and email to github 
 $ git config  --global user.name "lahu kolte"
 $ git config  --global user.mail "lahu.kolte@causecode.com" 
6.Now create a repository in your github account. 
   Create readme file for your repository
    TYpe as follows:
     $mkdir html5
    $ cd html5
   $ git init 
   $ touch Readme
 Now open readme file and type something save and close the file.
 Now add the file 
 $ git add readme.txt
Now commit the task which is snapshot of all the files at that point of time
 $ git commit -m 'first commit'
Whatever we have done uptil now is on local clone of the file means on client side 
so we have to push commited data on github account
 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:lahucausecode/html5.git  //this will Set the origin for the Html5repo
    $ git push -u origin master
